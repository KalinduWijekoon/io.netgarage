title: level02
url: level2@io.netgarage.org

`ssh` to the above url via port no `2224` as mentioned in [io.netgarage.org](http://io.netgarage.org/)

You can use putty client or you can use openSSH with the command `ssh -p 2224 level2@io.netgarage.org`

Use __`XNWFtWKWHhaaXoKI`__ as the password. 

Just like the previous level, cd to the /levels directory and find the relevent level files. Find the `level02` executable file and run it using

    $ ./level02
    
Then you will get an out put saying __`source code is available in level02.c`__ 

`cat level02.c` to view the source code
